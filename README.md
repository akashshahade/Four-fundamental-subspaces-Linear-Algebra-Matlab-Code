# Four-fundamental-subspaces-Linear-Algebra-Matlab-Code
This is a MATLAB code to find out all 4 fundamental subspaces in Linear Algebra.

% Bases of four fundamental vector spaces associated with the matrix A.

1. cs- basis of the column space of A

2. ns- basis of the nullspace of A

3. rs- basis of the row space of A

4. lns- basis of the left nullspace of A
