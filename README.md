# Four-fundamental-subspaces-Linear-Algebra-Matlab-Code
This is a MATLAB code to find out all 4 fundamental subspaces in Linear Algebra.

% Bases of four fundamental vector spaces associated
% with the matrix A.
% cs- basis of the column space of A
% ns- basis of the nullspace of A
% rs- basis of the row space of A
% lns- basis of the left nullspace of A
